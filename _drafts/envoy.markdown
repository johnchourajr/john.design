I am humbled, and very excited to announce that I'll be joining the extremely talented team at [Envoy](http://www.weareenvoy.com/), on May 12th as a Designer. I'm so stoked to work alongside this group of talented folks. I'll be departing Biola University's Design Studio, after an invaluable 3 year run. It's the end of an era for sure, but that means it's a new beginning. *Here we go!*
