In under 48 hours at ENVOY's Summer Hack 2014, my team (The [Envoyeurs^1](#refer)) sprinted and hacked together an addictive game for social voyeurs. We call it [peepr^2](#refer), it's a game for those who like to watch, a.k.a. *the social peepr's*. Built on the web, *peepr* challenges it's players to see how well they know who they follow on Twitter. It's a basic "who said it" game, but with tweets, along with a leaderboard to track the biggest *peepr's* out there (get it?).

It was an awesome experience, being able to design this along side some awesome teammates. My fellow Envoyeurs include [Josh Austin^3](#refer), [Josh Hemsley^4](#refer), Kevin Simmons, Josh Eck, David Koontz, and Keenan Staffieri. The dream team, a buncha champs.

In the end, we were voted #2 by our ENVOY peers, which is awesome. And the most rewarding part ... the game is actually really fun to play. Don't believe me? [Then give it a peep for yourself](http://playpeepr.com).

We'll post our process soon on the Envoyeurs website.
