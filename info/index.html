  ### I live life one day at a time with by best friend and letterer extraordinaire, my wife Alex. We live in sunny Long Beach, CA with our rascal of a cat. We both created and manage the amateur food and drink pairing blog, A Good Pair.

  ### Object & Subject is a personal experiment of mine, it's a design workspace by and for me. A space to keep my work, as well as a place for my side projects and writing. The name represents a balance that I strive to achieve in my work; between the visual world, and that of ideas. My aim is to see and practice design as both a science and an art.
