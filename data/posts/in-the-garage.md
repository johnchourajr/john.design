## Let's get real.

## So much of what it means to be a designer today is in and around the computer.

## There is "edit, undo."

## Version history.

## Multiplayer collaboration.

## Design systems.

These things are not bad. They enable us to be faster, systematic, and more efficient designers.

While you can be extremely creative within those systems and tools, it's a little different than the tools and frame of mind from our art education (remember that BFA that we spent 100k+ on?).

## Mark making.

## Figure-ground.

## Expression.

## Decisions.

## Experimentation.

About 4 months ago I started going into the garage late at night, while my wife and baby daughter were asleep, to create artwork.

I want to be clear, I cringe a little inside when I say "artwork," because I know how it sounds. But, that's what it is.

These aren't designs. These don't have a problem they are solving. They don't serve a function. These are expressions and feelings put on paper.

At first, they felt like large scale doodles.

I started there, for the most part, just putting down marks that reflect what I'd naturally doodle.

Then the fear came.

## What do I make now?

## How do I know where to make the first mark?

## How will I know what looks good?

## What if I mess up?

## Why does it matter if I mess up? (oh, right, I'd be wasting material)

## What if I just lean into it? (you mean, if I just don't care?)

So much of the beginning was struggle. I wasn't really sure where I was going, or what I would make.

I would just _begin_, and that's when magic happens.

With a piece of scrap wood on the table (yes, I started with using scrap wood laying around the garage) I begin a small mark-making exercise.

It was some of the most insignificant/useless pieces of wood that gave me permission to let my guard down. Most of which turned out to be the coolest pieces I made.

A large, store bought canvas carries an expectation of "don't fuck it up, you just spent \$30 on me, and this better be damn good."

So I bought some cheap large format paper to do large-scale sketches.

And then peace came (even if just a little bit).

## I don't know what I'm about to make.

## I'm just going to start.

## This is about play.

## I'm going to let myself make mistakes.

There is no brief, no plan, no edit > undo, no system; just your body, a tool, and a surface.

## Making art is about decision making.

I'm constantly in the struggle between the fear and peace of putting marks down on the page. Pushing forward some abstract intuition; creation with zero plan in mind.

Some of the time I do start with plan, but the best ones come naturally, like a gesture.

## Our digitally designed world is that way it _is_ so we can apply our craft very usefully to various enterprises and businesses.

## It's survival, and I love what I do.

## But...

## I was needing a space to _just_ create.

## In the garage.

## Late at night.

## Family asleep.

## Just me, a tool, and a surface.
