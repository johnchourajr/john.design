Hello, typophiles! Have you ever been overwhelmed by a sea of font folders with combined .ttf, .woff2, and .otf files? Ever wished for a magic solution that could neatly organize them? Well, your wish has been granted! Introducing the **[Font File Separatornator](https://github.com/johnchourajr/font-file-separatornator/tree/main)** (cue infomercial music) – the script you didn't realize you needed, but now can't live without.

Installing fonts is a routine task when working on a design project or setting up a new computer. It often involves navigating through various font families, weights, and mixed files, which can involve time-consuming manual labor. To make this process more efficient, I created this magical script script. The **[Font File Separatornator](https://github.com/johnchourajr/font-file-separatornator/tree/main)** is designed to rescue you from the chaos of mixed-up font files and bring order to your digital life.

## How to Use This Marvelous Script

### Step 1: Grab the Goods

First things first, head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/johnchourajr/font-file-separatornator/tree/main) and download the latest and greatest version of Font_File_Separatornator.sh.

### Step 2: Place It with Love

Once you’ve got the script, place it in your directory of choice. Anywhere you want. It’s flexible like that.

### Step 3: Open a Terminal (Cue Dramatic Music)

Navigate to your folder of destiny using your terminal. If you don’t know how to open a terminal, we might need to have a different conversation.

### Step 4: Command Your Script

Here’s where the magic happens. Give your script permission to run:

```bash
chmod +x Font_File_Separatornator.sh
```

Then, let it do its thing:

```bash
./Font_File_Separatornator.sh
```

And the best part? You can run this script over and over without worrying about duplicates. It’s like magic, but better.
