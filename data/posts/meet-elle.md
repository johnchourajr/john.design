Just a little itty-itty announcement, my wife Alex and I have started on the most amazing project of our lives by welcoming our little daughter Elle (pronounced "L") Joy Choura into the world.

She was born on August 1st, 2018 and she's an amazing little chunk of cuteness. I'm only two weeks into her being here, and I couldn't feel more blessed to be a dad.

Fun nerdy Dad fact, her name is a palindrome, and so is her birthday (Elle and 8.1.18). ðŸ¤“
