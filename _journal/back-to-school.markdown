## This spring I'm going back to school.

But, errrr uh... probably not in the way you're initially assuming. I'm going back to teach. Yes, nearly 6 years post-graduation, I'll be tromping back to my alma mater to teach an upper-level design class as an adjunct professor. 

I've always wanted to teach in some capacity, so when the opportunity came along, I leaped at it headfirst. In my time of preparation for these students, A few things have been circling my mind. Most importantly, **do I still believe in higher education?** For which my answer is; spoiler, *yes*, I do. But, a simple yes begs the deeper probe of *'why?'*.

Higher Education for designers must do the following:
a) Teach the principles (ie. Form, Balance, Contrast, Hierarchy, etc.)
b) Inform historical context (ie. How our field came to be.)
That is all for the purpose
b) 

good professors mentor their students.

Why is always a good question. It forces a look 

I'm energized at the prospect of teaching design, it's a topic I'm passionate about and I'll have a lot to say. But in the process of preparing for the course, I've been thinking through a few things that are important to address publically.
