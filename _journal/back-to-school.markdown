This spring I'm going back to school.

But errrr uh, probably not in the way you're assuming. I'm going back to teach.

This spring I'm going back to school, but probably not in the way that you're most likely assuming. Just a short 6 years since I graduated from college and I'm excited that I'll be returning to my alma mater as an adjunct professor.  

There have been a lot of discussions stirring lately from design-folks like [@DannPetty](https://twitter.com/DannPetty/status/804770214361513984), go look at those responses, it's interesting stuff. But, never-the-less, it's been on my mind lately as I approach the spring 2017 semester (never thought I'd say that combinations of words again.)
