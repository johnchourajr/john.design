I'm excited to announce that next week I'll be joining [Payoff](https://www.payoff.com/) as a Product Designer. I'll be working with [Josh Hemsley](https://twitter.com/joshhemsley) and the Payoff team to build out their brand, and mobile products, and ultimately reenvision the world of personal finance. With this new move it will be difficult to leave my friends and teammates at Envoy, a group of some of the most talented and quality human beings that I've had the pleasure to work with. But, times change, and I couldn't be more excited.

The balloons in the header of this article were hand-crafted by me entirely out of CSS/JS. If you want to see how I made it, check out the [Codepen](http://codepen.io/jchoura/pen/vOvrJv).
