# create-gatsby (alpha)

Create Gatsby apps in an interactive CLI experience that does the plumbing for you.

## Quick Overview

Create a new Gatsby app by running the following command:

```shell
npm init gatsby
```

or

```shell
yarn create gatsby
```

It will ask you questions about what you're building, and set up a Gatsby project for you.

_Note: this package is different from the Gatsby CLI, it is intended solely to create new sites._

## Options

If you'd like to set up a minimal site without answering any prompts you can run the following command, including your chosen site directory.

```
npm init gatsby -y <site-directory>
```
